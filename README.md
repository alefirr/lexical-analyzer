# Lexical analyzer

This is a JavaScript language lexical analyzer.
The program builds tables of lexeme types and prints them after scanning.

### Recognized lexeme types:
- numbers (float, hexadecimal, etc.)
- string constants (JS does not have chars)
- comments
- reserved words
- operators
- delimiters
- identifiers

Note that JavaScript syntax does not contain preprocessor directives.
